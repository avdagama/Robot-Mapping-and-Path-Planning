# Robot Mapping and Path Planning

This project involved using the Webots application to simulate robot's actions given python code.
The code can be run by opening the world file with the webots application.

The Mapping algorithm tells the robot to traverse the environment and map any walls it can detect with it's distance sensors.

The Path planning algorithm uses the WaveFrontPlanner technique to determine the shortest path from the robot's location to the end goal, 
the robot then traverses that path.
